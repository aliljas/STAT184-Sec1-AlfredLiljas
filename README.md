 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
This repository was made with the goal of learning how to use GitHub and to learn how to use repositories within GitHub. I added files to the repository as well as committing the changes and pushing them to the server. I worked with an old activity as well as the diabetes dataset.
While doing this assignment, I created a new text document, I added the text document to the repository as well as an R file and a csv file. I also changed the settings for ignored files. I didn't run into many issues as the process was well outlined in the assignment.
